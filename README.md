## Functionality

    The page loads when you open the url
    When first loaded all it has is a search bar.
    When you type in a city into the bar and click search it loads weather
    the weather it loads is for the current time as well as the next 5 days
    When you click search it also adds that to your search history
    if you click one of your previous searches for the data again

## Developement Process

    I started by setting out a basic layout in HTML and then adding a basic template with bootstrap so I would know where to place things.
    Then I started with the search functionality.
    Originally just pulling and placing the current weather.
    I then developed the process to print the 5 day forecast.
    Finally I developed the search history programming.

## Usage

    Type in a city you want to know the weather of and hit search. Then you can just read the data and know the weather currently and for the next 5 days.

## Technologies Used

    CSS (bootstrap)
    JS (moment, jquery)
    HTML
    OpenWeather api

## Challenges Encountered

    I did not find too many encounters with this project. I feel as if I had a pretty good understanding of all of these concepts used.
